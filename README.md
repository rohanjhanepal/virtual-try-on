# virtual-try-on
This project aims to use generative methods to fit a cloth on to a person for better online shopping experience using GANs.
We made a web app for easier access.


Instructions:
1. vton.yml file is conda environment that can be used to install dependencies and create environment to run the project.
2. download and extract files & folders from drive and paste in to root directory
    drive: 
3. Run server.py to run the server and try on the project yourself

The fashion try on framework allows customers to try on clothing and fashion items
virtually before purchasing from E-commerce. The virtual cloth try on consists of
two main tasks: separates person body (pose, shape, color) from their clothing and
then generates new images of wearer dressed in other cloth. The GAN model takes
two input images of wearer dressed in another cloth namely, image of target fashion
item and image of customer (preferably a full body image). The photorealism of
generated image is made possible due to the implementation of state of art neural
network namely Generative Adversarial Neural Network. GANs contain two inner
architectures namely, Discriminator and Generator. Generator takes noise as input
and tries to generate output whereas, Discriminator takes sample input messages
(fashion image in our case) and verifies the image generated by the generator and
calculates the loss function. This adversarial nature of architecture results in
improvement in generation-based tasks and highly capable in generating realistic
images out of nothingness. This model utilizes segmentation maps and body key-
point formation for improved accuracy.
